## GitHub for biologists: A painless introduction to a powerful collaboration tool

### Partner Activity

**Instructions:** Below are some silly icebreaker questions. With a partner, take turns doing the following:

-   Answer a question

-   Commit your changes

-   Push to Github

-   Pull your partner's changes

To start, be careful not to make changes on the same line -- this can introduce merge conflicts! But if you are feeling comfortable with the basics above, feel free to play around and see if you can identify and resolve conflicts.

**Question 1.** If you could be an animal for a day, which would you choose and why?

**Question 2.** Is a hot dog a sandwich? Justify your answer.

*Answer:* I don't believe a hot dog is a sandwhich. I cannot justify my answer other than the hot dog portion feels like a disqualification from being a sandwhich meat.

**Question 3.** What is your go-to karaoke anthem?

*Answer:*

**Question 4.** Which fictional ecosystem would you study if you could? E.g., the sand dunes of Arrakis, the Misty Mountains of Middle Earth.

*Answer:*
